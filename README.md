# My React + Vite Project

This is a high-performance React project using **Vite**, with a CI/CD pipeline set up via GitHub Actions. The project follows best practices for linting, testing, and optimization.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sargsalbert/canvas-app-2d.git
   cd canvas-app-2d

  Install dependencies: npm install
  Run the development server: npm run dev
  Run tests: npm run test
  Build for production: npm run build

### Performance Optimizations 
This project is optimized for speed and efficiency using:
- **Vite's native optimizations**: Fast cold starts, hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized builds.
- **Tree-shaking & dead code elimination**: Reducing bundle size by removing unused code.
- **Minification & Compression**:
  - Uses **Terser** for minification.
  - Supports **gzip compression** for smaller asset sizes.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Ensures clean and consistent code.
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automates linting, testing, and build checks before merging.


## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
The CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality before merging by running:
1. **Linting & formatting checks** (ESLint & Prettier)
2. **Unit tests** (Vitest)
3. **Production build verification** (Vite)

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs on **every pull request**.

## Deployment
This project is deployed on **Vercel**.
